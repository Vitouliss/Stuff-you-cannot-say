## StuffYouCannotSay

This is a script I wrote that checks when ANY player chats...If the player says a word in the table in any form a message will appear saying they said a bad word.

Currently it does nothing to the player other then show a message. It is up to you to code the consequence in. 

It's a very simple script a wrote...But very useful.
